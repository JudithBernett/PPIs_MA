1.  Use training and validation set, save weights. (output mirror-double or mirror-medium)
2. Load these weights and test them on the valisation set => give validation performance measurements. (output mirror-double_test-val or mirror-medium_test-val)
3. Run spot_min_loss.py on step 1's output to see when to stop final training. This give you an epoch number E.
4. Re train using training AND validation sets as training set, use the test set for testing, and stop at epoch E. => give final performance measurements. (output test-mirror-double_train-val or test-mirror-medium_train-val)
